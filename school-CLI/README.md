School System App

**School System App** is an app where we aim to keep track on `Students` and `Professors` with their basic info such as *name, age, birthdate, phone number, etc*. It is for their identification incase we need it.

A `Professor` can teach multiple `Subjects` but a `Subject` can have only 1 `Professor`. We are tracking how much they make each year through teaching. A Professor's salary depends on how many subjects they are teaching. Let's say each subject costs P5,000.

Each `Student` can enroll in only one `Course` at a time, given line-up of susbjects depends on their *year* and `Course`. `Students` can be also *local* or *international*. 

Every `Student` will take every `Subject` *related* on their `Course`. Each `Course` has uncustomizable line-up of `Subjects`. For every `Course`, number of `Students` enrolled on the said `Course` will be tracked.
